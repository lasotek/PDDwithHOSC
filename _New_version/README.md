# PDD with HOSC - A New C++ Code

[Code currently being developed](HOSCAnalysis/). It often changes. The current version has been enhanced with a parser. It is possible to define HOSCs in a text input file and perform interlocking operations. The results can be seen in the text output file. The compiled program is called from the console as a command:
```{r}
HOSCAnalysis -i <input file> -o <output file>
```

Example of input file with comments can is [input.txt](HOSCAnalysis/input.txt).
