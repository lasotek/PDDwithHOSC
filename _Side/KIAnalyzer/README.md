# Side project - Graph Kirchhoff Index 
Analysis with HOSCs is a good tool for solving many problems in graph theory. The Kirchhoff Index (KI), or so-called resistive distance, is one of the measures of information propagation derived from chemical graph theory, also applicable in telecommunication networks. The classical method of determining KI is based on calculating the pseudo-inverse of the graph incidence matrix. Using SVD, this parameter can be determined quite quickly. If any single link modification occurs in the graph, the operation must be performed from scratch. In information flow networks, we often have fixed clusters that can connect to each other in different ways. KIAnalyzer is a tool for such analysis. A simplified version of HOSC is used here because we are dealing with a single graph, not a 2-graph.
