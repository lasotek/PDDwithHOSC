# Influence of asymmetry of components for transfer functions of the Sallen-Key filter made of FDCFOA.

To determine the analysis, we should use following models:

![K_ud1](FDCFOA_CFMB_GGnd_Asym_K_u1.svg)

![K_ud2](FDCFOA_CFMB_GGnd_Asym_K_u2.svg)

![K_uc](FDCFOA_CFMB_GGnd_Asym_K_uc.svg)

Results are complex and are presented in [raw text form](Models.txt) and [post-processed pdf](Models.pdf). Nevertheless, we can conclude that for the common gain preservation to be 0, the equality of time constants ***C1b⋅R1b=C1a⋅R1a*** is very important.
The following examples test less or more realistic models:
